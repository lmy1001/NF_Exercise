1. To test the RealNvp in two-moon dataset, please run:

  python Run_RealNvp.py

2. To test the RealNvp in mnist dataset, please run:

  python Run_RealNvp_mnist.py

TODO:

1. After changing the couple layers, deeper network, activation functions in 
scale net and translation net, I found that the parameters in the code run the best performance, but it's still noisy in generation results

2. Improve the performance of RealNvp in mnist dataset (maybe change the Linear units to the convolutional units)
